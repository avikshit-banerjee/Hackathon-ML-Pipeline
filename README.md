# Hackathon-ML-Pipeline
This is a basic Data Science Hackathon Machine Learning Pipeline built using Ensemble and Stacking Methods in Python.

In this notebook, the pipeline required for Machine Learning Classification Hackathons has been provided with multiple variations in approach to suit the requirements of the dataset. The structure of the notebook is as follows:

* **Importing libraries and loading data**
* **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
* **Data Visualitions**
* **Dealing with missing data**
* **Labelling and scaling of data features**
* **Feature Selection and Engineering**
* **Creating a baseline classification ML model**
* **Ensemble Modelling**
* **Stacking**
* **Performance Evaluation and Model Selection**
* **Generating final predictions and submission**
